  <title>Create a New Hunt</title>
  <prose>
    <p>
      To create a hunt, you need the <b>secret</b> for this site. Ask the
      site owner if you don't know it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>key</b> is a short identifier for the hunt; it will be
      used as part of the URL. The key must only contain LETTERS,
      NUMBERS, and DASHES. The hunt key is permanent; you cannot
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hunt's <b>name</b> is the name that puzzlers will see. This
      can contain whatever you want, including spaces. It can even be
      the same name as a previous hunt (though you probably
      shouldn't). You'll have the option of changing it later.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>password</b> is the password for the hunt, and gives
      permission to edit the hunt.
